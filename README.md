# QryptoTalk: BB84 Quantum Key Distribution Simulator
**Experience the magic of quantum cryptography** - A visually stunning, interactive simulation of the BB84 protocol that makes quantum key distribution accessible to everyone.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Watch as Alice sends quantum bits to Bob through an animated quantum channel
- **Eve the Eavesdropper**: Toggle Eve's interference to see how quantum mechanics detects spies
- **Step-by-Step Learning**: Follow each stage of the protocol with clear visual explanations
- **Realistic Physics**: Accurate simulation of quantum measurements and basis mismatches
- **Error Detection**: See how Alice and Bob can detect eavesdropping by comparing measurement results
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Fully responsive design works on all devices

## How It Works

The BB84 protocol, developed by Bennett and Brassard in 1984, uses the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics to create an unbreakable encryption key:

1. **Alice prepares** qubits in random bases (rectilinear or diagonal)
2. **Bob measures** each qubit in randomly chosen bases
3. **They compare** basis choices to establish a shared secret key
4. **Eve's interference** introduces detectable errors when she tries to intercept

This simulation brings that process to life with beautiful animations and interactive controls.
